# Eirik Kirkeli's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Eirik Kirkeli and I am a student at Noroff Vocational College in Norway. On this page, I will display my journey from beginner to professional web developer.

I started my journey in 2022 as a beginner and invite you to see my progress into the fantastic world of web development. Check out my projects to see what I've been working on and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
